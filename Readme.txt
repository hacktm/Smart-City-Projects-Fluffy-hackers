Do you ever wanted to sign your transactions without any paper and be a eco-friendly?
Do you ever wanted to unlock your house when you lost your key without breaking the door?

Now you have the solution with our prototype.
 
We want to create a new path, a new way of using your signature instead of numbers and letters.
Without being written, your signature cannot be forged easily .

The gesture is read with Leap Motion device and we draw it and send it using Pubnub library to the web application.
Our project contains the following technologies .Net, javascript, CSS, jquery.

We can use this not only for games, how is now used, but practice in a Smart City :)
Or it can be a awesome way to unlock your PC.
